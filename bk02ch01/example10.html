        Here's what the Scottish biographer James Boswell had to say about puns:
        <blockquote>
            For my own part I think no innocent species of wit or pleasantry should be suppressed: and that a good pun may be admitted among the smaller excellencies of lively conversation.
        </blockquote>
        I couldn't agree more!
