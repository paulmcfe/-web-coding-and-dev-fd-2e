        As you enter the building, you'll see on the wall to your right
        a large, red button that says, "DO NOT PRESS!" You will be sorely 
        tempted to press that button. The desire to press that button will
        be well-nigh irresistible. However, I urge you in the strongest
        possible terms: <strong>Do not press that button!</strong>
