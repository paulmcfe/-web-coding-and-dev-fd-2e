        There once was a boy named Flibbertigibbet. Understand, first, that his parents most certainly did not give him that name when he was born. That would be cruel, and they were really quite nice people. No, they actually named him Filbert. Yes, they named him after a nut. They were nice people, but they were also silly people who often didn't think things through.
        
        One day, when Filbert was about year old, his mother was dandling him on her knee when, mid-dandle, he exclaimed "Momma!" Oh, his mother was overjoyed that not only had Filbert said his first word, but that word had been "Momma." She called her husband over and Filbert looked right at him and said "Dadda!" Amazing! They began pointing at him and saying "Filbert!, Filbert!" to get him to say his own name. After a while, Filbert creased his brow as though concentrating ever so seriously, then said "Flibbertigibbet!"
        
        Their jaws dropped. How could such a boy so young even know such a word, much less say it? Ah, therein lies a tale. Unbeknownst to his parents, Filbert's maternal grandmother had been secretly whispering "You're my little Flibbertigibbet" in the boy's ear ever since he was born. By the time he was a year old, Filbert didn't know many things, but there was one thing he did know with unshakeable conviction: His name was Flibbertigibbet!
